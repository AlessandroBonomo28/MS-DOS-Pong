# How to compile your own assembly programs and run them on MS-DOS
1) Clone git repository
2) Setup MS-DOS https://github.com/AlessandroBonomo28/MSDOS-setup
3) Install emu8086 to compile your assembly program into a .com executable https://github.com/AlessandroBonomo28/emu8086
4) Install https://winimage.com/ to transfer your .com executable into a virtual floppy disk
4) Write your program in emu8086
5) Compile your program and you will get a .com file
6) I have provided you a 'floppy1' virtual floppy disk. You can use winimage to inject the .com file into the floppy.
7) Once your .com is in the floppy you can enter the floppy into the virtual msdos machine
8) Mount the floppy with 'A:'
9) Enter 'dir' to check the content of the floppy
10) Enter the name of your .com file and MS-DOS will execute it
